            <h2>About Jinrui no Shōri</h2>
            <p>Jinrui no Shōri (Victory of Humanity in Japanese) is an exciting game inspired by the Attack on Titan (SNK) manga. Developed by a solo developer in his spare time, this fan game brings the bloody world of the titans to life.</p>
            <p>Currently in beta, Jinrui no Shōri offers an incredible gameplay experience in which players use three-dimensional equipment to take down massive titans. Although the game is still in development with some bugs, simple gameplay and terrible UI, it promises an immersive and challenging adventure for fans of the genre.</p>
